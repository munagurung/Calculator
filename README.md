This is a simple calculator built using JAVA Swing which can do four types of calculations: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. 
</p>
<br>
<h3>Implemented functionalities:</h3>
<p>
- It does calculation for two operands only. For example, 10.1 + 2.9.

</p>
<p>
- After the calculation of the two operand, the result can be used for next subsequent two operand operations. For example: 10.1 + 2.9 = 13. The result 13 can then be used for next operation, such as 13 * 2 = 26.

</p>
<p>
- Functionalities which restricts improper user input has been implemented. If a user inputs an operator more than one time, only the last entered operator will be used. For example, if a user clicks + then - operator, then the last entered operator which is - will be used for the calculation; the calculator display field will be updated with the correct operator.

<p>
- Furthermore, a user can't abuse the calculator by clicking lots of dot/ decimal '.' value. Only, one dot will be used no matter how many times the user clicks the dot button.
</p>
<p>
- The C button can be used to clear the calculator's memory for new two operand calculation.
